**Twitch Viewbot Proxy â€” Python Automation Tool for Twitch Viewer Simulation**


Twitch Viewbot Proxy is a Python-based Twitch viewer bot that uses SOCKS5/HTTP proxies to simulate multiple concurrent viewers on Twitch streams.
It features an easy-to-use GUI, supports headed and headless Chrome browsers, rotates proxies automatically, and can capture screenshots of streams in real-time.

**âœ… Works After August 2025 Twitch Updates â€” Simply use a JavaScript or iframe embed of the Twitch stream and direct the bot to the embed page instead of the main Twitch URL.**
If you don't have your own website you can create an embed page on https://forum.illphated.com/Forum-Embeds or https://illphated.com/submit-embed/ and then direct the bot to that page instead of directly to your twitch URL.
